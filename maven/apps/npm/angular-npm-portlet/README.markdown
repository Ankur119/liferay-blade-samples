# Angular npm Portlet

**Important:** This sample works for Liferay DXP Fix Pack 44+ and Liferay Portal
CE GA7+. The minifier fails on Liferay DXP 7.0 when JSDoc is present in a portlet. To resolve this, use Grunt uglify to remove the JSDoc comments. This process may take a long time, depending on the number of files that require an update.

The Angular npm Portlet sample provides a portlet that uses the
[Angular](https://angular.io/) framework to render its output.

For more details on this sample, see the
